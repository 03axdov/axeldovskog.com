                        I've been programming for about 6 years, mainly working on my own projects.
                        I'm particularly passionate about <span class="color-1">Machine Learning</span> and I also
                        have some experience with <span class="color-3">Web Development</span>. I'm also quite interested in <span class="color-2">Economics</span> in general,
                        which is why I'm doing a bachelors in International Business on the side.
                        <br><br>
                        In my spare time, I mainly enjoy working out with my friends, as well as reading (mainly Fantasy novels).

                        <br><br>
                        <span class="asoif">A Song of Ice and Fire</span> by George R.R Martin
